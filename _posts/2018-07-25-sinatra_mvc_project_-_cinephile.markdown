I spent 3 weeks on this project while working full time, an extra 8 days than what I hope to finish this project by.  (This website is not fully done but the project requirements are fulfilled. Meaning, I am going to submit this project because I fulfilled the checklist but there are parts of it, I need to finish in order for it to be a fully functioning website.)

I was going through the hurdles just like I did when I was working through the CLI Data Project and I had thoughts that I would not be able to go through this and looking back at it now knowing the project actually wasnt that complicated.

There were a few nights in the past 3 weeks I did not code at all( but all the while thinking about coding). Then towards the end when I start to see the end of the tunnel, I would power through nights, sleeping at 4am then waking at 7.

The beginning of the project was easy.  I knew exactly what I needed from watching the first ten minutes of this video:

That youtube video was a review in forms using pirates and ships as examples.  Highly recommended, just simply following the guildelines of checking your params as you build. I was researching for a template to clone but after a short while I figure it's fast if I just do it from scratch.  It's also good practice for memory of building your app, so you know what you need.

I then spent about 3 hours drafting a picture of all my object models and the relationships between each other.  Getting it correct and understanding how you want your models to be.

So since I am creating a movie review object, I have to focus and put movie in the forefront of my mind.  Then I have to think about what a movie has and then subsequently modeled the other objects around the Movie class.

Then I realized based on previous lessons, the login page and sign up page is 1 click away. So I created the login form right on the index.erb file. But you should be able to log in. I wanted to streamline a user's experience, and make it more intuitive.
