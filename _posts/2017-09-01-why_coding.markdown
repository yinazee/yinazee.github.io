When I was around 7 years old, I had broken the VCR by cramming the Wizard of Oz VHS tape into it.  I hear the machine attempting to push the tape out on its own because it was stuck and the wheels of the tape did not settle into the spindles, so it kept making noises.  I had spotted screws on the corners of the VCR and immediately thought of my dad who had used a screwdriver before when fixing things around the house.  I managed to disassemble the VCR and free the VHS tape. And there unbeknowst to me at the tender age of 7, had managed to fix the family's only VCR.  (A huge deal considering we only watch TVB dramas through renting VHS tapes and we did not have cable, and I would've been heavily scolded.)

This memory has always stuck with me. Without elaborating, I feel regret that I have not believed in myself more when I was younger.  

But that feeling ends.  The whole culture of coding is synynomous with forward thinking, enlightment, independence, creativity, effective communication, collaboration, problem-solving, empathy, - all of the ideal human qualities that could improve our world, our community.  Not to romanticize it too much, but those are genuine goals I want to strive for in my work and personal life.  I have struggled advancing in my work and finding a work environment with like-minded individuals.  Someday, I want to build a path for myself instead of relying on someone's approval.  I want to gain enough skills and confidence to take bigger risks in life.  I need to dissect my life and take a look.
