I did not come from a coding background. I had no experience in code speak. So the fact that I could pass this lab was a guarantee that at any moment that I needed help, I got help. Finishing this lab was a community effort.

I tried to sneak in doing some lessons during work as well. Doing as much as I could. Sometimes I would be coding till 3am and need to find time to do chores. But I realized that doing coding past 1am for me is inefficient. Because communicating So time management is essential.

So how long should you work on a problem before you ask for help? On average, I have spent a day trying to do it on my own. Hindsight, I shouldn’t have waited so long and struggled because I started to justify how I think the code should be written verses how the code should actually be written. I have copied certain formats from examples and filled in with commands for the lab I am working on, only to be told, that that function isn’t really meant for this lab in this situation. So it’s ok to ask for help. If you can’t figure it out in 3 hours, chances are you can’t figure out in a day. It’s best to identify where the problem is, work on the next part of the lab and come back to that part after a break. If you still can’t figure it out after googling, and playing around with your method, then ask for help. I am a tactile learner, I learn by doing and I learn by looking at examples. There are different ways to write codes for a function so it’s best to grasp the concept.

I like to leave the comments in there to help me remember what that code there is for. This is my best resource https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html.

Reading the spec also helped in writing the code to pass for it.
