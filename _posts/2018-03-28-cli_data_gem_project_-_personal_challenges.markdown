*Please read: [my technical entry ](http://yinaz.com/cli_app_-_the_moment_of_truth) on my CLI Data Gem Project*

*This entry is about the personal challenges of tackling this lesson.*

I'm sitting here 12:36am on a Tuesday night with my full face of make up still on.  I could barely keep my eyes open but I'm determined to complete this entry because it is 2 months overdue.)

I was constantly questioning myself whether coding was for me.  I did think about quitting.

But what ended up happening was just giving up an approach I had and just tackle it from another angle.

As soon as one code starts working, the other ones fail.

Before I know it, it's 2am and have work the next day.

In the beginning, I wanted to invest 2 hours on worknights and 10 hours on days off.  Boy was I wrong about that!  My energy level was just so low after a work night.

Then...I came across a Martin Luther King quote.

*"If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward."*

So that's what I've been doing. No matter what, I'm not going to give up on myself and the future that I envisioned.

That's a lot to give up on.

So I have been working on a tighter personal regimen.  Better eating, yoga, and sleeping patterns.  I try not to feel guilty about watching TV (but I do).  I've rewarded myself with  American Crime Story: Assasination of Gianni Versace. (It was soooooooo good.) Some people can just power through the lessons, but I have to stop comparing myself to others.  I just have to be realistic.

I also realized that it's okay to be a beginner all over again.

Goodluck!
