Regular Expression or Regex is using a method or a search algorithm to look for patterns in a string, which is similar to the 'find' function in Word. Stephen Cole Kleene, a major contributor to discovering Regex, discovers it on the philosophical notion that within a group of texts or individual objects, we are able to identify patterns, manipulate information to satisfy a condition or interpret information to reveal different truths.

Below are some useful tools and resources on using Regex:

I remembered back when I had to take standardized tests, teachers would often remind us students, to skim reading long passges for the reading parts.  They stress the importance of finding keywords to answer questions correctly in a limited amount of time.  We need to know what keywords to look for; how do we interpret or -misinterpret information given to us to satisfy a condition?

For example:

Let's write a Regex code that will match common letters on each line:

abcdefg
abcde
abc	

solution: [abc]{3}

[abc] = any letters in this square bracket that matches what you are looking for
[abc]{2} = this means only the combo of the first 2 letters
[a-z]{3} = this also works too.

Within just a few examples, we've grasped a basic concept and combination of commands we can use to search for matches!

I would strongly recommend using Regexone if you are a true beginner. It's very user friendly in introducing the usage of the algorithms.
